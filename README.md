## Motivation and main features
Due to the increasing demand for tutors of students. However, the current tutoring platforms have some disadvantages as follows: collecting fees from tutors, limiting the ability of two parties to connect directly with each other.
Therefore, we have built this web platform so that tutors and students can connect with each other more easily. Web features:
- Login, Logout, Account Registration
- Post to find a tutor, Delete post, Edit Post
- Search posts for tutors (by filter or query by title of the post)
- Looking for suitable tutors (by filter)
- Upgrade to a tutor account
- Connect tutors and students
- Update and set information security modes
- Rate tutor after connection
